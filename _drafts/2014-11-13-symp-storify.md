## 10th November 2014: Chemical biology across the University of Oxford - what happened?

On 10th November 2014 the ChemBio Hub team held a cross-departmental symposium at the Sa√Ød Business School in the centre of Oxford. Attendees from a broad range of departments in the chemical and biological sciences met to hear about cutting-edge research projects happening across the University. This started lots of useful conversations that generated ideas for new research collaborations.

We decided to use Twitter as a way to reach out to those who weren't able to attend the symposium. We chose a hashtag (#OxCBH) in advance and publicised this to participants. This allowed us to use Storify to collate the tweets and images from the event - perfect for embedding into our blog. Take a look at what happened below.
